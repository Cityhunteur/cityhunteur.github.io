Inspired by the legendary reading lists by Bill Gates and others, here is a list of some of the best books I read recently and would definitely recommend. I've also included books I plan to read soon. As you'll notice this list covers a wide range of topics and I hope you find one that is inspiring. Some of those books are the ones I tend to go back to regularly.
